        <p id="message" class="hidden">In the shadows of Gotham, a hero is born each dayâ€¦ but today, the spotlight falls on you.<br> 
            In the dark streets of Gotham, even the Dark Knight takes a moment to honor the legends among usâ€¦ and today, that legend is YOU.<br><br>
            
            ðŸŽ‰ Happy Birthday, Jaan! ðŸŽ‰<br> 
            Like Batman, you bring strength, courage, and mystery to those around you.<br> 
            You're not just another citizenâ€”Youâ€™re the hero your world deserves.<br> 
            Strong, fearless, and always one step aheadâ€”just like the Bat himself, and today, you deserve to be celebrated like the legend you are.<br><br>
            
            Tonight, let the Bat-Signal shine in your honor.<br> 
            May your day be filled with excitement, adventure, and maybe even a surprise visit from the Joker (cake edition, of course ðŸŽ‚ðŸ˜‰).<br><br>
            
            Gotham salutes you.<br> 
            The Bat salutes you.<br> 
            And most of all, I do.<br><br>
            
            ðŸ¦‡ Stay fearless. Stay legendary. Stay you, Jaan.<br>
